# DAT602 Machine Learning


# Build Process
This project can be derived and used with different services from the IBM Watson to do more analysis. This would require some changes to the code, such as API details, graph legend, mapping of the graph perhaps and some minor stuff.

# Deployment
The machine learning AI that has been used in this project comes from IBM Watson machine, and I'm using the Tone Analyzer from that machine to analyze the tone of the text that the user types in. This project has been built with p5.js and runs in the browser.

# Usage & Explanation
The user is required to type in the text, then the graph will show the confidence of two different tones that it reads from the text over time. The graph works better when the text has good grammar and makes sense.
